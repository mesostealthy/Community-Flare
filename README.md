- Block Shared Quests inside Battlegrounds. (That is so annoying, stop it!)
- Easily selectable Community boxes for Main and Other Communities.
- Automatically accept invites from Battle.NET friends or Community members.
- Report Queue status, i.e. Joined, Left, Drop, Popped to Community.
- Uninvite Players that are AFK when you are Queing up.
- Automatically give out Raid Assist to your Community members. (Requires Raid Leadership.)
- Slash commands for various stuff, like /comf to check some counts inside a Battleground.
- Warning before accidentically casting a Hearthstone or Teleporting out of a Battleground.
- Restrict users from using the PING system without being Raid Leader or Assistant.
- Base code for different Locales, so far, only enUS added for support. (If you want to translate to others, please contact Mesostealthy in Alterac Valley Maniacs, or comment down below.)
