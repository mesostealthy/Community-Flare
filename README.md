Community Flare is a project dedicated to making life easier to be able to sync up and play Battlegrounds with your friends easier.

The core features include:

- Community Database Member tracking, matches played, last online, etc.
- Auto Queue settings when your party leader queues up for Battlegrounds.
- Block Shared Quests inside Battlegrounds. (That is so annoying, stop it!)
- Easily selectable Community boxes for Main and Other Communities.
- Automatically accept invites from Battle.NET friends or Community members.
- Report Queue status, i.e. Joined, Left, Drop, Popped to Community.
- Uninvite Players that are AFK when you are Queing up.
- Automatically give out Raid Assist to your Community members. (Requires Raid Leadership.)
- Slash commands for various stuff, like /comf to check some counts inside a Battleground.
- Warning before accidentically casting a Hearthstone or Teleporting out of a Battleground.
- Restrict users from using the PING system without being Raid Leader or Assistant.
- Base code for different Locales, so far, only enUS added for support. (If you want to translate to others, please contact Mesostealthy in Alterac Valley Maniacs, or comment down below.)

Quite a few other Quality of Life features and/or parts of the above core that improve your Community Battleground queuing experience.
